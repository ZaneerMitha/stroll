## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What is it?

People love to get out and explore new places, but often they struggle with finding where to go or they struggle to have the motivation to leave the house. This app gives people a new place to go everyday and consistently challenges them to take a stroll!

The premise of the app is each day a notification is sent out and a new location is available on the app. These locations are be places like farmers markets, green space, monuments, etc. If you complete the stroll, you get a streak/points and then you can compete against your friends. In the future, it could even involve trading the points in for free coffee at one of the locations or something similar, but it would just be competing against friends and having a new cool place to visit every day in the beginning. Additionally, the app is only be available for Boston and NYC users to start.

## üíª Technologies

Stroll is an iOS application that is written completely in Swift, and programmed in Xcode. The application uses a Model, View, Controller (MVC) system, and the interface is based in SwiftUI. All user and location data is stored in Google Cloud Firestore and Firebase. The "Map" section of the application is populated using Apple MapKit.
